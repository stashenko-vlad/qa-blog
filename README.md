# QA Blog by Vlad

Welcome to my personal blog where I share my journey to becoming a QA (Quality Assurance) specialist.

## About Me
I'm transitioning from a non-tech background to the IT industry. My goal is to become a professional software tester and land my first job in QA.

## What You'll Find Here
- Weekly updates on what I'm learning
- Practical examples: test cases, bug reports
- My experience with QA tools (YouTrack, uTest, etc.)
- Personal reflections on growth, mindset, and consistency

## Why I Made This Blog
I believe in learning in public. This blog helps me stay accountable, track my progress, and maybe help others who are on the same path.
