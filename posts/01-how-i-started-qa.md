# How I Started My QA Journey

My name is Vlad. I decided to change my career path and become a software tester.

It all started when I worked at a casino, but I wanted something more stable and growth-oriented. I took my first QA course, read books, watched videos, and began practicing on platforms like uTest.

Why I chose QA:
- I enjoy finding bugs and improving user experience
- I like logical thinking and structured approaches
- It's a great entry point into IT without needing to code right away

What I plan to do:
- Keep learning every day
- Share my progress in this blog
- Land my first job in IT

Stay tuned!
