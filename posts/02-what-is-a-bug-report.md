# What Is a Bug Report?

A bug report is a document that describes an issue or unexpected behavior in a system, so that developers and other team members can understand and fix it.

## Why It's Important
A clear and well-written bug report helps:
- Save time during debugging
- Avoid misunderstandings
- Speed up product improvement

## What Should Be in a Good Bug Report:
- Title: short and clear (e.g. "Login button doesn't respond")
- Steps to reproduce: how to make the bug appear
- Expected result: what should happen
- Actual result: what really happens
- Environment: device, browser, OS, app version
- Attachments: screenshots, videos if possible
- Severity: how serious the bug is
- Priority: how urgent it is to fix

## My Thoughts
Iâ€™m learning to write clear and structured bug reports. I realized it's not just about finding a bug, but also about communicating it in a way that makes it easy to fix.
